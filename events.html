						<p>X will consist of our online hunt, CryptX, and six on-site events — Design, Quiz, Gaming, Programming, Speaking, and Surprise Event. Each event will have a unique theme based around Make.</p>
						<p>At X, we want all participants of a team to come together as a startup and Make something. All events are interconnected to each other, and add towards the final goal of creating a useful product.</p>

							<h2>Quiz</h2>

							<p>Number of members per team: 2</p>

							<p>X has always been known for turning the traditional Quiz format on its head, and this time it’s no different. With a time-bound Preliminary round followed by a gruelling Final round, it’s an endurance challenge at its very best.</p>
